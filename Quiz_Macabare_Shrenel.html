                        Why major in Information Systems
                        Many people begin to feel overwhelmed or out of their depth when they hear about IS. The truth is, while IS can be a challenging field to get into, if you have a passion for it, it’s a great option to consider. Information systems encompass a wide field of study that bridges business with computer science. Under IS, you can study all kinds of things, like computer information systems, security, web development, cloud computing, database concepts, programming, and more! 
                        
                        As we continue to live and strive in the 21st century, it’s all about information systems!</h5>

                        <h5 class="mt-3">Both information technology and information systems deal with computer-based systems to an extent, but require different education and training. Think of information technology as a subset of information systems—while IS covers the set of information as a whole, IT refers specifically to the technology aspect within that system. The field of information systems works as the bridge between technology and people, whereas information technology focuses on helping them utilize and make sense of that system. The two disciplines are related, but have distinct sets of learnings and career paths</h5>
